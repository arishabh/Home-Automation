# Home-Automation
I designed this code and PCB layout to control my appliances of room using the phone. I had also created a mobile application but haven't attached it here.
I designed the PCB on Eagle.

Thing needed for this project are:
- 5 Relays
- 6 PBTs
- 1 Arduino Nano
- 1 Bluetooth Module
- 1 ULN 2003
Thats it!
